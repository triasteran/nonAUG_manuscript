This directory contains scripts and files that were used to calcualte PhyloCSF score for genomic regions. 

This pipeline outputs .fasta files of 120-mammals alignments for an extension per transcript in fasta3/ directory for subsequent PhyloCSF score calculation. 
It uses following scripts: 

* bed_files_creation_and_maf_download_and_extraction.py:
    0. create all necessary directories for temporary files 
    1. download original .maf files with 120-mammals alignment, unzip it, create index file (.bb)
    2. create bed files with genomic coordinates of extensions
    3. extract blocks of aligments using original .maf files and .bed files using mafExtract utility 
    4. remove all large downloaded and created input files (.bb, .maf, .maf.gz)
    of note: it parallelizes operations using list of chromosomes. 

* alignment_preparation.py 
    1. merge .maf files into 1 maf
    2. stitch blocks into 1 .fasta file taking into acount strandness 
    3. remove gaps and format fasta -> final alignment file 
    
 * PhyloCSF_score_calculation.sh - PhyloCSF score calculation. 
 It uses GNU parallel over chromosomes and transcripts.
